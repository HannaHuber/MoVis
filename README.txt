Alternatively, you can open the file index.html in your browser.
The preferred browser is Chrome.

# Known Issues
Due to the large size of the datasets, some operations may take some time. In the filtering view, filtering movies before averaging increases performance.
The data was taken from the Internet Movie Database [1] and processed using the library imdb-py [2], Tableau Desktop [3] and Matlab [4]. It may contain errors.
